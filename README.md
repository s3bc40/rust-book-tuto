# ðŸ¦€ Rust Book Tutorial

This repository contains my personal journey through the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). It includes various projects and exercises I've completed while learning the Rust programming language.

## Projects

Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

- [x] adder: A simple library crate for adding two numbers -> Writing Automated Tests
- [x] collections: Experiments with Rust's collection types.
- [x] enum-ip-addr: Example of using enums to represent IP addresses.
- [x] guessing\_game: A classic number guessing game. -> First workshops with Rust
- [x] hello\_cargo: A basic "Hello, Cargo!" project.
- [x] hello\_world: The quintessential "Hello, World!" program.
- [x] minigrep: A command-line tool to search files, inspired by `grep`. -> I/O Project: Building a Command Line Program
- [x] rectangles: A project for working with structs and methods, focused on calculating rectangle areas.
- [x] restaurant: A simulation of restaurant operations to learn about modules
- [x] rust-chapt3-workshop: Workshop from chapter 3 of the book.
- [x] rust-err-handling: Practicing error handling techniques in Rust.
- [x] rust-gen-types-traits-lifetime: Experiments with generics, types, traits and lifetimes.
- [x] rust-ownership: Exercises to understand Rust's ownership concepts.
- [x] rust-struct: Practicing the use of structs.

- [ ] Next -> 13. Functional Language Features: Iterators and Closures

## Getting Started

To explore these projects, you'll need to have Rust installed. You can download it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Each project directory contains its own `Cargo.toml` file, so you can build and run them using Cargo:

```bash
cd <project_directory>
cargo build
cargo run
```
